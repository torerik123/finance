# Finance
- Virtual stock trading app where users can buy and sell stocks. 

This was made as part of [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
Some distribution code was provided, and I was assigned to implement the register, quote, buy, sell, index and history functions.
I also changed the CSS and added a settings page where users can change their password and add more cash to their account.
